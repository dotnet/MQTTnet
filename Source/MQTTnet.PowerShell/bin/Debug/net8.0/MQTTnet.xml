                This interval defines the period of time that the broker stores the PUBLISH message for any matching subscribers
                that are not currently connected.
                When no message expiry interval is set, the broker must store the message for matching subscribers indefinitely.
                When the retained=true option is set on the PUBLISH message, this interval also defines how long a message is
                retained on a topic.

            The quality of service level.
            The Quality of Service (QoS) level is an agreement between the sender of a message and the receiver of a message that defines the guarantee of delivery for a specific message.
            There are 3 QoS levels in MQTT:
            - At most once  (0): Message gets delivered no time, once or multiple times.
            - At least once (1): Message gets delivered at least once (one time or more often).
            - Exactly once  (2): Message gets delivered exactly once (It's ensured that the message only comes once).

            The MQTT topic.
            In MQTT, the word topic refers to an UTF-8 string that the broker uses to filter messages for each connected client.

                When a client connects to a broker it can connect using either a non persistent connection (clean session) or a
                persistent connection.
                With a non-persistent connection the broker doesn't store any subscription information or undelivered messages for
                the client.
                This mode is ideal when the client only publishes messages.
                It can also connect as a durable client using a persistent connection.
                In this mode, the broker will store subscription information, and undelivered messages for the client.

                In MQTT 5, user properties are basic UTF-8 string key-value pairs that you can append to almost every type of MQTT
                packet.
                As long as you don’t exceed the maximum message size, you can use an unlimited number of user properties to add
                metadata to MQTT messages and pass information between publisher, broker, and subscriber.
                The feature is very similar to the HTTP header concept.

                - At most once  (0): Message gets delivered no time, once or multiple times.
                - At least once (1): Message gets delivered at least once (one time or more often).
                - Exactly once  (2): Message gets delivered exactly once (It's ensured that the message only comes once).

                In MQTT 5, user properties are basic UTF-8 string key-value pairs that you can append to almost every type of MQTT
                packet.
                As long as you don’t exceed the maximum message size, you can use an unlimited number of user properties to add
                metadata to MQTT messages and pass information between publisher, broker, and subscriber.
                The feature is very similar to the HTTP header concept.
