    <description>MQTTnet is a high performance .NET library for MQTT based communication. It provides a MQTT client and a MQTT server (broker).</description>
    <releaseNotes> * [Core] Performance optimizations.
* [Core] Due to performance reasons the timestamp of log messages is now in UTC format.
* [Core] Added several packet validations.
* [Core] Log messages now contain the complete source path including parent components.
* [Core] The adapter now has an _Endpoint_ definition as string containing remote IP and port.
* [Client] Received messages are now processed completely in the worker thread without creating new Tasks.
* [Client] Fixed wrong calculation for sending keep alive packets (thanks to @cstichlberger)
* [Client] A clean disconnect (via DisconnectAsync) will no longer throw an exception.
* [ManagedClient] The managed client is moved to a separate nuget package.
* [ManagedClient] Added an own message format with extended properties like ID (BREAKING CHANGE).
* [ManagedClient] Fixed a loading issue of stored application messages (thanks to @JTrotta).
* [Server] Added support for other WebSocket sub protocol formats like mqttv-3.1.1 (thanks to @israellot).
* [Server] The takeover of an existing client sessions is now treated as a _clean_ disconnect of the previous client.
* [Server] The pending messages queue per client is now limited to 250 messages. Overflow strategy and count can be changed via options (thanks to @VladimirAkopyan)
* [Server] Keep alive checking is now suspended while large packages are being received (and thus the client is connected). Keep alive checking continues after a large packet is received completely.
* [Server] Rewritten the _ConnectedClients_ API and added new features for disconnecting and Endpoint information (IP etc.).
* [Server] Added settings for disabling persistent sessions and defining a max pending messages queue size per session.
* [Server] Persistent sessions are disabled by default (BREAKING CHANGE!).
* [Server] Added a new interceptor which is invoked before a new message is added to the client queue.
* [Server] Added support for Linux servers by dividing IPv4 and IPv6 support and adding new options (BREAKING CHANGE!).
* [Server] Gracefully closed connections are no longer reported as warnings.
