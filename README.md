# MQTTnet

MQTTnet is a high performance .NET library for MQTT based communication. It provides a MQTT client and a MQTT server (broker). The implementation is based on the documentation from <http://mqtt.org/>.

## Features

### General

* Async support
* TLS 1.2 support for client and server (but not UWP servers)
* Extensible communication channels (e.g. In-Memory, TCP, TCP+TLS, WS)
* Lightweight (only the low level implementation of MQTT, no overhead)
* Performance optimized (processing ~70.000 messages / second)*
* Uniform API across all supported versions of the MQTT protocol
* Interfaces included for mocking and testing
* Access to internal trace messages
* Unit tested (~200 tests)
* No external dependencies

\* Tested on local machine (Intel i7 8700K) with MQTTnet client and server running in the same process using the TCP channel. The app for verification is part of this repository and stored in _/Tests/MQTTnet.TestApp.NetCore_.

### Client

* Communication via TCP (+TLS) or WS (WebSocket) supported
* Included core _MqttClient_ with low level functionality
* Also included _ManagedMqttClient_ which maintains the connection and subscriptions automatically. Also application messages are queued and re-scheduled for higher QoS levels automatically.
* Rx support (via another project)
* Compatible with Microsoft Azure IoT Hub

### Server (broker)

* List of connected clients available
* Supports connected clients with different protocol versions at the same time
* Able to publish its own messages (no loopback client required)
* Able to receive every message (no loopback client required)
* Extensible client credential validation
* Retained messages are supported including persisting via interface methods (own implementation required)
* WebSockets supported (via ASP.NET Core 2.0, separate nuget)
* A custom message interceptor can be added which allows transforming or extending every received application message
* Validate subscriptions and deny subscribing of certain topics depending on requesting clients
* Connect clients with different protocol versions at the same time.

## MQTTnet Server

_MQTTnet Server_ is a standalone cross platform MQTT server (like mosquitto) basing on this library. It has the following features.
* Running portable (no installation required)
* Runs und Windows, Linux, macOS, Raspberry Pi
* Python scripting support for manipulating messages, validation of clients, building business logic etc.
* Supports WebSocket and TCP (with and without TLS) connections
* Provides a HTTP based API (including Swagger endpoint)
* Extensive configuration parameters and customization supported

## Supported frameworks

* .NET Standard 1.3+
* .NET Core 1.1+
* .NET Core App 1.1+
* .NET Framework 4.5.2+ (x86, x64, AnyCPU)
* Mono 5.2+
* Universal Windows Platform (UWP) 10.0.10240+ (x86, x64, ARM, AnyCPU, Windows 10 IoT Core)
* Xamarin.Android 7.5+
* Xamarin.iOS 10.14+

## Supported MQTT versions

* 5.0.0
* 3.1.1
* 3.1.0
